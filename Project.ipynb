    "## SECTION B\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1 INTRODUCTION\n",
    "#### 1.1 THE PROJECT\n",
    "This project, which I have named \"Movies 101\", allows a user to gain information about a movie. This information is requested from the Open Movie Database (OMDb) using the OMDb API.\n",
    "In this section, I will explain what an API is and how it works. I will also describe how a RESTful API works. I will then discuss how the OMDb RESTful API is communicated with. After this, I will provide the documentation for how the program works, and I will then give a detaied commentary on small sections of the code. I will conclude with a reflection section.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 WHAT IS AN API?\n",
    " - An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of functions and operations that interact with an operating system, application, or other service. The API is used to request information from these services in order to create a program or application. An API enables communication between two applications to take place.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 WHAT IS A RESTful API?\n",
    "- A RESTful API is based on representational state transfer (REST) technology, which is often used in web services development as a means of communication.\n",
    " - A RESTful API uses HTTP requests to get data from another website or other service. \n",
    " - RESTful APIs use less bandwidth, which makes them effective in communicating with websites.\n",
    " - RESTful APIs are often used in cloud websites such as Twitter because they are stateless, which means that they do not recall past requests and treat each operation as a new one to be understood with only the information given. This means they take up less memory and run more quickly than stateful operations, which store information. Stateless communication also allows for more changes to be made to programmes more easily.\n",
    " - RESTful APIs break up a transaction into multiple smaller pieces that are responsible for aspects of the transaction. This allows for greater flexibility.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### 1.4 THE OMDB API: WHAT IS IT AND HOW IS IT INTERACTED WITH?\n",
    "\n",
    " - This API allows a user to request information from the OMDb site through specific parameter calls, for example:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```omdb.request()```\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - The API displays the requested data in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, which is easy to read and is lightweight.\n",
    " - The API allows the program to receive the content of the request and store it to a variable in JSON format as follows:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```json.loads(res.content)```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2 DOCUMENTATION\n",
    " - When the program is run, it will display the titles of the movies that the user has already searched from the searched.txt file, provided that the user has already searched movies. If no movies have been searched yet, the program will inform the user of this.\n",
    " - The program then prompts the user to either enter a movie title to search for, or to enter 'x', which will exit the program and stop prompting the user for movie titles.\n",
    " - If the user enters a title for a movie that does not exist in the OMDb library, the program informs the user of this:\n",
    " \n",
    "```'We cannot find all the information about this movie. Please make sure you have entered the title correctly.'```\n",
    "\n",
    " - This is picked up by a 'KeyError' exception and could be for various reasons, including:\n",
    " \n",
    "     \n",
    "      - The movie does not exist in the database.\n",
    "      - The user has made a spelling error in the title of the movie.\n",
    "      - The user has entered characters that the database cannot understand, such as: \"the li0n kíng\".\n",
    "      \n",
    "     \n",
    " - The 'IndexError' occurs if the database does not contain data for all the information fields requested. For example, if the database does not contain information about the ratings for the movie, it will display:\n",
    " \n",
    "```'We cannot find all the information about this movie. Please make sure you have entered the title correctly.'```\n",
    "\n",
    " - The above mentioned error cases were the only cases that I could find.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3 DETAILED COMMENTS ON THE CODE\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Setting my API key as the default key for every request made to the API means that I only have to put it into my program once at the beginning instead of entering it each time I communicate with th API:\n",
    "\n",
    "```omdb.set_default('apikey', \"897bb360\")```\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The following code checks if there is any text in the searched.txt file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```with open('searched.txt') as searchedAlready:\n",
    "    searchedAlready.seek(0)\n",
    "    first_char = searchedAlready.read(1)```\n",
    "    \n",
    " - If there are no characters found in searched.txt, the program displays this to the user:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```if not first_char:\n",
    "    print('Welcome to Movies 101! You have not searched for any movies yet.')```\n",
    "    \n",
    " - If searched.txt contains information about previosly searched movies, the program prints out the titles of the searched movies as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) I put my program in a while loop to continuously ask the user for movie titles, but allowed the user to exit the program by inputting 'x':\n",
    "\n",
    "```movieToSearch = input('Enter the title of the movie you would like to search here. To exit the program, enter \"X\". ' )\n",
    "   if movieToSearch == 'x' or movieToSearch == 'X':\n",
    "       break```\n",
    "\n",
    "4) The following section of code checks if the movie title entered by the user has already been searched and is stored in searched.txt. If the information is stored in the text file, the program retrieves this information and displays it to the user without making the request to the OMDb API for the information:\n",
    "\n",
    "```with open('searched.txt','r') as searchedAlready:\n",
    "                if 'movieToSearch' in searchedAlready.read():\n",
    "                    movie = searchedAlready.find(movieToSearch)\n",
    "                    print(movie)```\n",
    "                    \n",
    " - By storing information about movies that have already been searched in the searched.txt file, the program souces this information locally when the user inputs a searched title again. This shortens the running time of the program as it does not have to communicate with the database and go through multiple links to get the information and display it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) The code shown below communicates with the OMDb API, requesting information about the movie title that the user has inputted. It stores this data in JavaScript Object Notation, which is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data.                    \n",
    "```res = omdb.request(t=movieToSearch, r='json')\n",
    "   content = json.loads(res.content)```\n",
    "\n",
    "6) The following code retrieves information about the movie. I selected some information to display to the user but left out some of the information fields that I thought were not of importance.\n",
    " \n",
    "```print('Plot: ' + content['Plot'])\n",
    "print('Release date: ' + content['Released'])\n",
    "print('Age restriction: ' + content['Rated'])\n",
    "print('Runtime: ' + content['Runtime'])\n",
    "print('Genre: ' + content['Genre'])\n",
    "print('Cast: ' + content['Actors'])\n",
    "print('Director: ' + content['Director'])\n",
    "print('Production: ' + content['Production'])\n",
    "print('Language: ' + content['Language'])\n",
    "print('Country: ' + content['Country'])\n",
    "print('Awards: ' + content['Awards'])\n",
    "print('Ratings: ' + 'Internet Movie Database: ' + content['Ratings'][0]['Value'] + ', ' + 'Rotten Tomatoes: ' +        content['Ratings'][1]['Value'] + ', ' + 'Metacritic: ' + content['Ratings'][2]['Value'])\n",
    "print('imdbID: ' + content['imdbID'])\n",
    "print('BoxOffice: ' + content['BoxOffice'])\n",
    "print('Website: ' + content['Website'])```\n",
    "\n",
    "7) The following code capitalises the first letter of each word of the title entered by the user so that it looks neater and more professional when displayed.\n",
    "ie, the titles are displayed like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Taken\n",
    "   True Grit\n",
    "   The Lion King\n",
    "   The Great Gatsby```\n",
    "   \n",
    "as opposed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```taken\n",
    "    True grit\n",
    "    the Lion king\n",
    "    the great Gatsby```\n",
    "\n",
    "8) The code given below opens searched.txt in a read and write format (a+) so that the file does not write over the items already searched when a new title is written to the file:\n",
    " \n",
    "```with open ('searched.txt','a+') as searchedMovies:\n",
    "        movieToSearch = movieToSearch.title() \n",
    "        searchedMovies.write(movieToSearch + ', ' + 'Plot: ' + content['Plot'] + ', ' + 'Director: ' + content['Director'] + ', ' + 'Language: ' + content['Language'] + ', ' + 'BoxOffice Price: ' + content['BoxOffice'] + ', ' + 'Website: ' + content['Website'] + ', ' + 'Release Date: ' + content['Released'] + ', ' + 'Rated: ' + content['Rated'] + ', ' + 'Runtime: ' + content['Runtime'] + ', ' + 'Genre: ' + content['Genre'] + ', ' + 'Cast: ' + content['Actors'] + ', ' + 'Production: ' + content['Production'] + ', ' + 'Country: ' + content['Country'] + ', ' + ('Ratings: ' + 'Internet Movie Database: ' + content['Ratings'][0]['Value'] + ', ' + 'Rotten Tomatoes: ' + content['Ratings'][1]['Value'] + ', ' + 'Metacritic: ' + content['Ratings'][2]['Value']) + ', ' + 'IMDb ID number: ' + content['imdbID'] + ', ' + ', ' + 'Awards: ' + content['Awards'] + ', ' + 'Website: ' + content['Website'] + '\\n')```\n",
    "                            \n",
    "9) The 'except' function checks for two errors, a Key Error and an Index Error:\n",
    " \n",
    "```except KeyError:\n",
    "       print('We cannot find all the information about this movie. Please make sure you have entered the title correctly.')\n",
    "   except IndexError:\n",
    "       print('We cannot find all the information about this movie. Please make sure you have entered the title correctly.')```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4 RESTROSPECTIVE SECTION\n",
    "#### 4.1 GENERAL OVERVIEW\n",
    "This project challenged me in multiple ways. It took me a while to get to the core of what the brief was asking of me and this resulted in a few false starts and a bit of frustration. However, I feel that these struggles helped me to learn, through my own research, how to effectively communicate with Python. The setbacks also challenged me to do my best and to keep trying until I got it right. I got help from a few friends who looked at my code and pointed out areas that I could fix and improve, and this really helped me to pick up mistakes that I otherwise would have missed. \n",
    "\n",
    "At first this project looked incredibly daunting. I kept thinking about all the things I wasn't sure how to do in Python and all the things that I didn't know. I anticipated struggle, and I unfortunately went into the project with this mindset. I feel that this is the reason why I initially doubted my ability to understand and successfully complete the project. Once I had the core of my program, I asked a friend to take a look at it and point out possible errors or misunderstandings. I fully expected that I might need to restart my whole project because I was on the wrong track. However, it turned out that I had the basic concept down and just needed to reshuffle some things and refine my code. This project therefore surprised me by showing me that I know more than I think I do, and my mindset has become much more positive through the process of working on the project. I know that it is not the most well-written, refined and professional program but I learnt a lot while doing it and am happy with the final outcome. I know that there are some features that I could have added to the program, and there are a few things I would have liked to add but despite much research, I could not figure these out. I have accepted that this is part of the process of learning and that it means that there are things I can still work on. I will discuss some of the possible shortfalls of the program that could be improved in the following section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2 PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED AND HOW I SOLVED THEM\n",
    "1) Initially, I struggled to get the information to read and disply information from the file correctly; my code looked like this:\n",
    " \n",
    "```print('Welcome to Movies 101! These are the movies you have already searched: ')\n",
    "   with open('searched.txt') as searchedMovies:\n",
    "       print(searchedMovies)```\n",
    "       \n",
    " - This gave the following output:\n",
    " \n",
    "````Welcome to Movies 101! These are the movies you have already searched: \n",
    "<_io.TextIOWrapper name='searched.txt' mode='r' encoding='cp1252'>```\n",
    " \n",
    " - After much research, I figued out that this was because I was because I was simply printing the file location without reading the data in the file.\n",
    " - With the help of StackOverflow, I fixed this issue and now my code looks like this:\n",
    " \n",
    "```searchedTitles = []\n",
    "   with open('searched.txt') as f:\n",
    "       for line in f:\n",
    "           comma=line.find(',') #searches each line for the position of the first comma, which indicates the end of the movie    title\n",
    "           title = line[0:comma]\n",
    "           searchedTitles.append(title) #appends the title to a list\n",
    "           print('Welcome to Movies 101! These are the movies you have already searched: ')\n",
    "           for m in searchedTitles: #where 'm' is the movie title\n",

    " - I would have liked to include a Graphic User Interface to make the program more user friendly but this was very complex and I unfortunately did not have time to incorporate this feature.\n",
    " - I realise that I did not use functions within my program. I would have liked to incorporate these but I could not find sections of my code that would work more efficiently with a function.\n",
    " - I think that the way the text is displayed in my searched.txt file is a bit messy, but I struggled to find a better way to display it.\n",
    " - When the program runs the 'except' part of the code, it does not write the movie to the file if an exception is caught. I tried multipe ways of fixing this and rearranging my code but unfortunately I have not been able to fix this aspect of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    " - I wanted to add the posters for each movie to be dispayed with the movie information. I know that this can be done by using web scraping, but despite extensive research, I could not quite figure this out.\n"
